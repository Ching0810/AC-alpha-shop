# AC-alpha shop project

This is a very first React project from Alpha camp.
There will be a series of stage to achieve expected standard, so I'll keep updating version including further function like new page, component, logic, etc.

The image below shows current result (20230928):



# Prerequisites
* Node.js 14.18.1
* React 18.2.0


# Installation and Execution
1. Please ensure that Node.js and npm are well installed in your local environment.
2. Find a folder where you want to put this project, open Terminal, and run the command for cloning:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ching0810/AC-alpha-shop.git
```
3. Then, you'll see a directory called "AC-alpha-shop". Enter the directory and run the command (would take a while, be patient):
```
npm install
```
4. After installment, run:
```
npm run dev
```
5. The project is ran successfully while seeing the following info in Terminal:
```
webpack compiled successfully
```
6. Press "ctrl + c" in Terminal if you want to stop running the project.
